# 3D Game Development Unity

In Game Development Studio, students will work in teams to create a single digital game or other game project. Over the course of the semester, students will brainstorm, research, design, and develop a digital game. The philosophy of the course is learning through doing, and the majority of student work time will be spent in actual design and production, which will be structured and guided by the instructors. This production time will be supplemented by in-class exercises, readings and discussion, and talks from visiting game developers. At the end of the semester, each group will have produced a playable digital game.
